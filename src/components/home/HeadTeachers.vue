          We were so lucky to to have the good fortune to have the head teachers
          we did. Mr Knight started with innovation and courage from the schools
          opening as it was a relatively new concept for a church school, Mr Harrision took the torch after Mr Knights retirement allowing for a area of time I can personally relate to having had my tenor from 1986-1990.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphText">
          Mr Harrision who I had the good fortune to be taught by had such a
          gentle nature he was easily respected by staff and students. He always seemed to come across as having a passion for the school and would always go above and beyond to be approachable and friendly.

          And finally Mr Bloomfield who saw the school into it's twilight years.
          Taking the school from the trinity status into the amaglation phase
          into as we know now Christ The King. A series of dedicated teachers
          who excelled at being the very best for the staff and students.
