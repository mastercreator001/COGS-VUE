            Ah who doesn't like food well I think we'd be hard pressed to find any student in the entire school who didn't enjoy lunch breaks. I sure did but given the small nature of the School space was an essenial element and so were the tables and the balalnce bar wea and I'm sure many of you played with tipping lunch boxes off the table (well the boys anyway). Perhaps you were sensiable I sure wasn't and no doubt paid for my mischief a number of times.

            I'm the the school wouldn't have been as popular as it was had it not been for the food and the dinner staff. Well as an army is run on it's stomach so a school schould run no differently especially as children do so much running around it burns allot of energy. The dinner ladies were amazing in what they cooked as it was all managed in house perhaps not as much these days but a hot meal was need and given come the magic lunch hour. Dinner time was a chance to eat socialise outside school limitations but also a chance to play study and prepare for an afternoon of studing.

            Cafeteria antics anyone ?
            
            Who remembers the task of the water jugs. I'm sure they never changed over the years and students who were deemed as responsible were etrusted with this task to fill them and layout the tables and chairs. I remember the job of removing the tables to the side to clear the area or a chrismas fate perhaps but alwyas loved the fact that the library was everso close if you needed a book to read as well.
            
            Morning breaks were my favourite as we were able to get the odd morning biscuit as hey were dusted in fine granulated sugar and had sultanas in them. I often finding myself craving for such but I have never foun and alternative to satisfy the needs.
